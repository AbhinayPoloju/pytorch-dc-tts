anger_0_sam_0093|for a full minute he crouched and listened
anger_1_sam_0340|it was like the beating of hoofs
anger_2_sam_0098|shall i carry you
anger_3_sam_0039|the ship should be in within a week or ten days
anger_4_sam_0140|accept a fathers blessing and with it this
anger_5_sam_0398|in the car were unwin and harrison while jones sat with the chauffeur
anger_6_sam_0175|down there the earth was already swelling with life
anger_7_sam_0001|author of the danger trail philip steels etc
anger_8_sam_0180|if not lets say our prayers and go to bed
anger_9_sam_0014|now youre coming down to business phil he exclaimed
anger_10_sam_0155|wont you draw up gentlemen
anger_11_sam_0293|they were deep in the primeval forest
anger_12_sam_0266|they handled two men already both grubthieves
anger_13_sam_0214|besides he was paid one case of tobacco per head
anger_14_sam_0012|gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet
anger_15_sam_0319|and the edinburgh evening news says with editorial gloom
anger_16_sam_0065|they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
anger_17_sam_0078|then and at supper he tried to fathom her
anger_18_sam_0016|theres fort churchill a rifleshot beyond the ridge asleep
anger_19_sam_0225|i was brought up the way most girls in hawaii are brought up
anger_20_sam_0252|obrien had been a clean living young man with ideals
anger_21_sam_0015|its the aurora borealis
anger_22_sam_0187|ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine
anger_23_sam_0499|and right there i saw and knew it all
anger_24_sam_0204|the wolfdog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him
anger_25_sam_0289|they are not regular oyster pirates nicholas continued
anger_26_sam_0349|it was simple in its way and no virtue of his
anger_27_sam_0338|the fighting had now become intermittent
anger_28_sam_0253|he it was that lived to found the family of the patino
anger_29_sam_0331|poor little crookedleg was terribly scared
anger_30_sam_0142|such things had occurred before he told philip
anger_31_sam_0021|it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
anger_32_sam_0006|god bless em i hope ill go on seeing them forever
anger_33_sam_0158|does that look good
anger_34_sam_0259|think of investing in such an adventure
anger_35_sam_0032|since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
anger_36_sam_0496|and tom king patiently endured
anger_37_sam_0494|obrien took off his coat and bared his right arm
anger_38_sam_0483|beyond dispute corry hutchinson had married mabel holmes
anger_39_sam_0249|all eyes however were staring at him in certitude of expectancy
anger_40_sam_0339|they obeyed him and went here and there at his commands
anger_41_sam_0478|also she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the afterroom
anger_42_sam_0269|thats where they cut off the scottish chiefs and killed all hands
anger_43_sam_0139|he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
anger_44_sam_0190|next to them the canada jays were most persistent
anger_45_sam_0055|philip stood undecided his ears strained to catch the slightest sound
anger_46_sam_0486|for the rest he was a mere automaton
anger_47_sam_0062|the men stared into each others face
anger_48_sam_0342|seventeen no eighteen days ago
anger_49_sam_0368|i just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings
anger_50_sam_0402|curly rushed her antagonist who struck again and leaped aside
anger_51_sam_0113|i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
anger_52_sam_0230|do you know any good land around here
anger_53_sam_0025|i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
anger_54_sam_0301|but all my dreams violated this law
anger_55_sam_0307|very early in my life i separated from my mother
anger_56_sam_0077|it is the fire partly she said
anger_57_sam_0447|ah it is growing dark and darker
anger_58_sam_0490|both johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked
anger_59_sam_0371|it issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal
anger_60_sam_0391|but he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith
anger_61_sam_0138|in the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to jeanne
anger_62_sam_0265|the discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment
anger_63_sam_0356|you dont catch me at any such foolishness
anger_64_sam_0043|it seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with gregson
anger_65_sam_0124|it was jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks
anger_66_sam_0018|there was a change now
anger_67_sam_0417|it is also an insidious deceitful sun
anger_68_sam_0102|he will follow us soon
anger_69_sam_0327|they were less stooped than we less springy in their movements
anger_70_sam_0097|then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
anger_71_sam_0302|it is very plausible to such people a most convincing hypothesis
anger_72_sam_0383|to his surprise her answer was flat and uncompromising
anger_73_sam_0027|to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
anger_74_sam_0404|perrault found one with head buried in the grub box
anger_75_sam_0157|he had worshiped her as dante might have worshiped beatrice
anger_76_sam_0017|from that moment his friendship for belize turns to hatred and jealousy
anger_77_sam_0194|he drank of the water cautiously
anger_78_sam_0205|from now on were pals
anger_79_sam_0348|they only lifted seven hundred and fifty
anger_80_sam_0085|a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
anger_81_sam_0110|much replied jeanne as tersely
anger_82_sam_0146|of course that is uninteresting she continued
anger_83_sam_0329|ah indeed
anger_84_sam_0137|then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
anger_85_sam_0152|philip thrust himself against it and entered
anger_86_sam_0103|but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
anger_87_sam_0481|nimrod replied with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness
anger_88_sam_0168|low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
anger_89_sam_0073|the promoters eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
anger_90_sam_0297|theres a big english general right now whose name is roberts
anger_91_sam_0057|i have no idea replied philip
anger_92_sam_0291|the weeks had gone by and no overt acts had been attempted
anger_93_sam_0132|a cry of joy burst from philips lips
anger_94_sam_0060|anyway no one saw her like that
anger_95_sam_0495|he bore no grudges and had few enemies
anger_96_sam_0504|he was an athlete and a giant
anger_97_sam_0322|this is a common experience with all of us
anger_98_sam_0316|we had been chased by them ourselves more than once
anger_99_sam_0134|he obeyed the pressure of her hand
anger_100_sam_0287|keep an eye on him
anger_101_sam_0028|robbery bribery fraud 
anger_102_sam_0441|violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
anger_103_sam_0370|he saw all men in the business game doing this
anger_104_sam_0099|a maddening joy pounded in his brain
anger_105_sam_0430|nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance
anger_106_sam_0363|it is not an attempt to smash the market
anger_107_sam_0423|mcveigh when he returns from a trip to honolulu
anger_108_sam_0136|about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
anger_109_sam_0026|it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
anger_110_sam_0294|he had been foiled in his attempt to escape
anger_111_sam_0011|if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
anger_112_sam_0244|he was the soul of devotion to his employers
anger_113_sam_0321|the log on which lopear was lying got adrift
anger_114_sam_0054|there was nothing on the rock
anger_115_sam_0221|i dont know why youre here at all
anger_116_sam_0425|otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring
anger_117_sam_0196|he began to follow the footprints of the dog
anger_118_sam_0050|in spite of their absurdity the words affected philip curiously
anger_119_sam_0202|she turned fearing that jacques might see what was in her face
anger_120_sam_0037|i was the only one who remained sitting
anger_121_sam_0304|i graduated last of my class
anger_122_sam_0487|the river bared its bosom and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness
anger_123_sam_0413|but i am at the end of my resources
anger_124_sam_0061|philip snatched at the letter which gregson held out to him
anger_125_sam_0047|close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolfdog
anger_126_sam_0156|a strange fire burned in his eyes when thorpe turned
anger_127_sam_0243|i only read the quotations
anger_128_sam_0292|here in the midmorning the first casualty occurred
anger_129_sam_0067|surely i will excuse you she cried
anger_130_sam_0267|eli harding asked as shunk started to follow
anger_131_sam_0072|but who was eileens double
anger_132_sam_0263|joan looked triumphantly at sheldon who bowed
anger_133_sam_0209|it was not a large lake and almost round
anger_134_sam_0233|i never allow what cant be changed to annoy me
anger_135_sam_0439|at sea wednesday march 18 1908
anger_136_sam_0079|it was a large canoe
anger_137_sam_0195|but a strange thing happened
anger_138_sam_0284|there was no forecasting this strange girls processes
anger_139_sam_0177|she had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled
anger_140_sam_0325|whizzipbang lopear screamed with sudden anguish
anger_141_sam_0384|the farmer works the soil and produces grain
anger_142_sam_0380|but in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth
anger_143_sam_0270|and after the bath a shave would not be bad
anger_144_sam_0223|my im almost homesick for it already
anger_145_sam_0428|it was not exactly a deportation
anger_146_sam_0198|sometimes her dreams were filled with visions
anger_147_sam_0330|redeye never committed a more outrageous deed
anger_148_sam_0286|give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping
anger_149_sam_0038|well have to watch our chances
anger_150_sam_0105|only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
anger_151_sam_0275|there are no kiddies and half grown youths among them
anger_152_sam_0108|he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
anger_153_sam_0188|two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass
anger_154_sam_0008|gad your letter came just in time
anger_155_sam_0212|fresh cases still able to walk they clustered about the spokesman
anger_156_sam_0435|what do you mean by this outrageous conduct
anger_157_sam_0096|perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
anger_158_sam_0071|what was the object of your little sensation
anger_159_sam_0296|bassett was a fastidious man
anger_160_sam_0083|a shadow was creeping over pierres eyes
anger_161_sam_0192|he did not rush in
anger_162_sam_0081|what if she did not come to the rock
anger_163_sam_0088|he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
anger_164_sam_0400|manuel had one besetting sin
anger_165_sam_0416|the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
anger_166_sam_0422|halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider
anger_167_sam_0401|the man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club
anger_168_sam_0373|points of view new ideas life
anger_169_sam_0376|your price my son is just about thirty per week
anger_170_sam_0341|why doggone you all shake again
anger_171_sam_0283|the woman in you is only incidental accidental and irrelevant
anger_172_sam_0203|they were following the shore of a lake
anger_173_sam_0409|he could feel a new stir in the land
anger_174_sam_0353|here the explosion of mirth drowned him out
anger_175_sam_0185|the questions may have come vaguely in his mind
anger_176_sam_0352|im sure going along with you all elijah
anger_177_sam_0375|the butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants
anger_178_sam_0254|straight out they swam their heads growing smaller and smaller
anger_179_sam_0488|their love burned with increasing brightness
anger_180_sam_0276|oolong atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference
anger_181_sam_0485|each insult added to the value of the claim
anger_182_sam_0036|she turned in at the hotel
anger_183_sam_0387|bob growing disgusted turned back suddenly and attempted to pass mab
anger_184_sam_0218|the ringing of the big bell aroused him
anger_185_sam_0389|mab she said
anger_186_sam_0123|she had died from cold and starvation
anger_187_sam_0167|i was near the cabin and saw you
anger_188_sam_0397|call me that again he murmured ecstatically
anger_189_sam_0133|philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength
anger_190_sam_0257|they are coming ashore whoever they are
anger_191_sam_0394|its the strap hangers thatll keep us from going under
anger_192_sam_0059|his immaculate appearance was gone
anger_193_sam_0377|this sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place
anger_194_sam_0426|they do not know the length of time of incubation
anger_195_sam_0366|a wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding thursday the eighteenth
anger_196_sam_0095|a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
anger_197_sam_0388|it was my idea to a tee
anger_198_sam_0357|a month passed by and bonanza creek remained quiet
anger_199_sam_0479|i tried to read george moore last night and was dreadfully bored
anger_200_sam_0362|nope not the slightest idea
anger_201_sam_0033|he unfolded a long typewritten letter and handed it to gregson
anger_202_sam_0264|and i hope youve got plenty of chain out captain young
anger_203_sam_0042|how could he explain his possession of the sketch
anger_204_sam_0144|but there was something even more startling than this resemblance
anger_205_sam_0332|unconsciously our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm
anger_206_sam_0491|and as in denial of guilt the onelegged boy replied
anger_207_sam_0176|for the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap
anger_208_sam_0179|tomorrow im going after that bear he said
anger_209_sam_0211|it drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made
anger_210_sam_0171|and when you come back in a few days bring eileen
anger_211_sam_0193|it was edged with ice
anger_212_sam_0207|how much was it
anger_213_sam_0268|now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened
anger_214_sam_0440|yes sir i corrected
anger_215_sam_0386|i cant argue with you and you know that
anger_216_sam_0121|they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
anger_217_sam_0068|in a flash philip followed its direction
anger_218_sam_0480|tom spink has a harpoon
anger_219_sam_0418|the portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer
anger_220_sam_0448|i was hump cabin boy on the schooner ghost
anger_221_sam_0182|this time he did not yap for mercy
anger_222_sam_0104|she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
anger_223_sam_0335|redeye swung back and forth on the branch farther down
anger_224_sam_0242|i saw it when she rolled
anger_225_sam_0424|obviously it was a disease that could be contracted by contact
anger_226_sam_0172|gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar
anger_227_sam_0318|production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself
anger_228_sam_0343|you mean for this state general alberta
anger_229_sam_0145|i have to be careful of them as they tear very easily
anger_230_sam_0231|the resident commissioner is away in australia
anger_231_sam_0117|she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
anger_232_sam_0163|philip made no effort to follow
anger_233_sam_0184|dont you see im chewing this thing in two
anger_234_sam_0114|her words sent a strange chill through philip
anger_235_sam_0150|goodbye pierre he shouted
anger_236_sam_0258|soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays
anger_237_sam_0415|it lasted as a deterrent for two days
anger_238_sam_0317|he was a wise hyena
anger_239_sam_0154|he was smoothshaven and his hair and eyes were black
anger_240_sam_0310|massage under tension was the cryptic reply
anger_241_sam_0245|out of his eighteen hundred he laid aside sixteen hundred each year
anger_242_sam_0129|her face was against his breast
anger_243_sam_0220|a dead man is of no use on a plantation
anger_244_sam_0306|he was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary
anger_245_sam_0046|the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
anger_246_sam_0351|it was more like sugar
anger_247_sam_0022|hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
anger_248_sam_0280|ill be out of my head in fifteen minutes
anger_249_sam_0173|the date was nearly eighteen years old
anger_250_sam_0405|it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work
anger_251_sam_0084|scarcely had he uttered the name when pierres closing eyes shot open
anger_252_sam_0262|they wouldnt be sweeping a big vessel like the martha
anger_253_sam_0009|he turned sharply and faced gregson across the table
anger_254_sam_0035|he stopped and philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes
anger_255_sam_0393|already he had begun borrowing from the banks
anger_256_sam_0326|cherokee identified himself with his instinct
anger_257_sam_0053|suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
anger_258_sam_0241|i think its much nicer to quarrel
anger_259_sam_0247|they ought to pass here some time today
anger_260_sam_0273|they are big trees and require plenty of room
anger_261_sam_0049|gregson was asleep when he reentered the cabin
anger_262_sam_0197|such a dog the wise driver kills or turns loose
anger_263_sam_0497|king took every advantage he knew
anger_264_sam_0112|he was wounded in the arm
anger_265_sam_0408|the eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test
anger_266_sam_0100|you must sleep he urged
anger_267_sam_0051|the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
anger_268_sam_0501|youre joking me sir the other managed to articulate
anger_269_sam_0251|i may manage to freight a cargo back as well
anger_270_sam_0385|thats what carnegie did
anger_271_sam_0222|what part of the united states is your home
anger_272_sam_0024|it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
anger_273_sam_0030|i had faith in them
anger_274_sam_0063|yes it was a man who asked a stranger
anger_275_sam_0183|and the air was growing chilly
anger_276_sam_0498|the lines were now very taut
anger_277_sam_0277|mccoy found a stifling poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin
anger_278_sam_0169|suddenly jeanne stopped for an instant
anger_279_sam_0354|fresh meat they failed to obtain
anger_280_sam_0227|it was the same way with our revolvers and rifles
anger_281_sam_0080|what if jeanne failed him
anger_282_sam_0502|anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to molokai
anger_283_sam_0235|his voice was passionately rebellious
anger_284_sam_0290|one by one the boys were captured
anger_285_sam_0396|a rising tide of fat had submerged them
anger_286_sam_0358|they continued valiantly to lie but the truth continued to outrun them
anger_287_sam_0431|wada and nakata were in a bit of a funk
anger_288_sam_0118|pierre obeys me when we are together
anger_289_sam_0186|like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl
anger_290_sam_0355|a burst of laughter was his reward
anger_291_sam_0224|she nodded and her eyes grew soft and moist
anger_292_sam_0272|you can take a vacation on pay
anger_293_sam_0437|by that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell
anger_294_sam_0089|the nightglow was treacherous to shoot by
anger_295_sam_0295|and twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows
anger_296_sam_0278|it would give me nervous prostration
anger_297_sam_0075|there has been a change she interrupted him
anger_298_sam_0274|and raoul listened again to the tale of the house
anger_299_sam_0135|i am going to surprise father and you will go with pierre
anger_300_sam_0379|how old are you daddy
anger_301_sam_0069|it was his intention to return to eileen and her father
anger_302_sam_0076|the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
anger_303_sam_0170|there was none of the joy of meeting in his face
anger_304_sam_0064|the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
anger_305_sam_0056|pearces little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly
anger_306_sam_0023|a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
anger_307_sam_0164|he came first a year ago and revealed himself to jeanne
anger_308_sam_0372|he saw only the effect in a general sketchy way
anger_309_sam_0181|so cheer up and give us your paw
anger_310_sam_0074|and now down there eileen was waiting for him
anger_311_sam_0411|it will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand
anger_312_sam_0122|two years ago i gave up civilization for this
anger_313_sam_0126|each day she became a more vital part of him
anger_314_sam_0312|it lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass
anger_315_sam_0151|and macdougall was beyond the trail with three weeks to spare
anger_316_sam_0161|take away their foreman and they wouldnt be worth their grub
anger_317_sam_0390|ill go over tomorrow afternoon
anger_318_sam_0031|they were three hundred yards apart
anger_319_sam_0066|he saw jeanne falter for a moment
anger_320_sam_0482|and their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out
anger_321_sam_0350|is that pat hanrahans mug looking hungry and willing
anger_322_sam_0201|he cried and swung the club wildly
anger_323_sam_0147|a moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness
anger_324_sam_0045|he moved away as quietly as he had come
anger_325_sam_0314|thus was momentum gained in the younger world
anger_326_sam_0127|it was a temptation but he resisted it
anger_327_sam_0228|but it contributed to the smash
anger_328_sam_0013|he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
anger_329_sam_0412|there is another virtue in these bulkheads
anger_330_sam_0323|he considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat
anger_331_sam_0364|we have plenty of capital ourselves and yet we want more
anger_332_sam_0320|with my strength i slammed it full into redeyes face
anger_333_sam_0438|at sea monday march 16 1908
anger_334_sam_0005|will we ever forget it
anger_335_sam_0484|nosiree
anger_336_sam_0020|clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
anger_337_sam_0299|i tell you i am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot
anger_338_sam_0337|encouraged by my conduct bigface became a sudden ally
anger_339_sam_0216|the other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him
anger_340_sam_0143|ah i had forgotten he exclaimed
anger_341_sam_0160|you want to go over and see his gang throw dirt
anger_342_sam_0261|i have been doubly baptized
anger_343_sam_0410|so we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well
anger_344_sam_0403|his newborn cunning gave him poise and control
anger_345_sam_0238|it happened to him at the gallina society in oakland one afternoon
anger_346_sam_0395|as for himself werent the street railway earnings increasing steadily
anger_347_sam_0313|brokentooth yelled with fright and pain
anger_348_sam_0229|the last one i knew was an overseer
anger_349_sam_0392|there is that magnificent bob eating his head off in the stable
anger_350_sam_0445|the creative joy i murmured
anger_351_sam_0119|jeanne was turning the bow shoreward
anger_352_sam_0215|they die out of spite
anger_353_sam_0300|from my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror
anger_354_sam_0381|my names ferguson
anger_355_sam_0444|then you dont believe in altruism
anger_356_sam_0070|he would first hunt up gregson and begin his work there
anger_357_sam_0148|now these things had been struck dead within him
anger_358_sam_0178|every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
anger_359_sam_0360|but he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion
anger_360_sam_0101|you you would not keep the truth from me
anger_361_sam_0414|now our figuring was all right
anger_362_sam_0141|it seems like a strange pointing of the hand of god
anger_363_sam_0040|i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
anger_364_sam_0359|earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan
anger_365_sam_0281|i do not blame you for anything remember that
anger_366_sam_0255|you wont die of malnutrition be sure of that
anger_367_sam_0217|oppressive as the heat had been it was now even more oppressive
anger_368_sam_0419|the portuguese boy passed the hawaiian
anger_369_sam_0285|but what they want with your toothbrush is more than i can imagine
anger_370_sam_0213|between him and the beach was the canegrass fence of the compound
anger_371_sam_0210|its diameter was not more than two hundred yards
anger_372_sam_0443|he was worth nothing to the world
anger_373_sam_0236|dont you see i hate you
anger_374_sam_0052|it was a curious coincidence
anger_375_sam_0334|hell knock you off a few sticks in no time
anger_376_sam_0199|thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day
anger_377_sam_0034|men of seldens stamp dont stop at women and children
anger_378_sam_0092|he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
anger_379_sam_0429|quick was the disappointment in his face yet smiling was the acquiescence
anger_380_sam_0442|you live on an income which your father earned
anger_381_sam_0191|for a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
anger_382_sam_0305|they had no fixed values to be altered by adjectives and adverbs
anger_383_sam_0019|i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
anger_384_sam_0250|he had observed the business life of hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition
anger_385_sam_0240|wash your hands of me
anger_386_sam_0128|this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
anger_387_sam_0303|but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
anger_388_sam_0433|to her the bridge was tambo which is the native for taboo
anger_389_sam_0248|i had been sad too long already
anger_390_sam_0328|the fire people like ourselves lived in caves
anger_391_sam_0234|why the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil
anger_392_sam_0369|in partnership with daylight the pair raided the san jose interurban
anger_393_sam_0308|his infernal chattering worries me even now as i think of it
anger_394_sam_0346|get down and dig in
anger_395_sam_0082|his face was streaming with blood
anger_396_sam_0094|he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
anger_397_sam_0374|but lifes worth more than cash she argued
anger_398_sam_0010|im playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
anger_399_sam_0029|their forces were already moving into the north country
anger_400_sam_0446|he deluged me overwhelmed me with argument
anger_401_sam_0489|they were artists not biologists
anger_402_sam_0174|they were the presage of storm
anger_403_sam_0125|he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
anger_404_sam_0282|if you mean to insinuate  brentwood began hotly
anger_405_sam_0421|by golly the boy wins
anger_406_sam_0208|youth had come back to her freed from the yoke of oppression
anger_407_sam_0365|these rumors may even originate with us
anger_408_sam_0420|when i came to i was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically
anger_409_sam_0041|meanwhile ill go out to breathe a spell
anger_410_sam_0378|thats why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged
anger_411_sam_0324|it was not redeyes way to forego revenge so easily
anger_412_sam_0090|the singing voice approached rapidly
anger_413_sam_0106|the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
anger_414_sam_0237|so hughie and i did the managing ourselves
anger_415_sam_0344|he seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality
anger_416_sam_0434|a half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds
anger_417_sam_0159|they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
anger_418_sam_0347|they are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound
anger_419_sam_0109|do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
anger_420_sam_0345|she was trying to pass the apron string around him
anger_421_sam_0116|was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
anger_422_sam_0500|who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury
anger_423_sam_0166|two days ago jeanne learned where her fathers men were hiding
anger_424_sam_0333|this is no place for you
anger_425_sam_0086|death had come with terrible suddenness
anger_426_sam_0131|providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
anger_427_sam_0315|saxon waited for she knew a fresh idea had struck billy
anger_428_sam_0271|now please give a plain statement of what occurred
anger_429_sam_0246|you have heard always how he was the lover of the princess naomi
anger_430_sam_0003|for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
anger_431_sam_0058|i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
anger_432_sam_0336|so unexpected was my charge that i knocked him off his feet
anger_433_sam_0436|but martin smiled a superior smile
anger_434_sam_0382|daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man
anger_435_sam_0162|thats the subforeman explained thorpe
anger_436_sam_0406|and that was the last of francois and perrault
anger_437_sam_0200|he leapt again and the club caught him once more
anger_438_sam_0004|lord but im glad to see you again phil
anger_439_sam_0311|therefore hurrah for the game
anger_440_sam_0219|at first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened
anger_441_sam_0130|she was his now forever
anger_442_sam_0165|they are to attack your camp tomorrow night
anger_443_sam_0226|that came before my a b cs
anger_444_sam_0239|he cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter
anger_445_sam_0002|not at this particular case tom apologized whittemore
anger_446_sam_0298|this tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave saxon a little joythrill
anger_447_sam_0091|his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
anger_448_sam_0120|my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
anger_449_sam_0503|his beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy
anger_450_sam_0107|if you only could know how i thank you
anger_451_sam_0477|wada louis and the steward are servants of asiatic breed
anger_452_sam_0260|nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
anger_453_sam_0288|those are my oysters he said at last
anger_454_sam_0087|philip bent lower and stared into the face of the dead man
anger_455_sam_0153|macdougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger
anger_456_sam_0279|she said with chattering teeth
anger_457_sam_0048|he looked at the handkerchief more closely
anger_458_sam_0256|see the length of the body and that elongated neck
anger_459_sam_0149|for an instant he saw pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky
anger_460_sam_0232|i cannot follow you she said
anger_461_sam_0115|he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
anger_462_sam_0399|and heres another idea
anger_463_sam_0111|instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
anger_464_sam_0044|her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to philip
anger_465_sam_0309|white leghorns said mrs mortimer
anger_466_sam_0361|but he did not broach it preferring to mature it carefully
anger_467_sam_0367|there is not an iota of truth in it certainly not
anger_468_bea_0093|for a full minute he crouched and listened
anger_469_bea_0098|shall i carry you
anger_470_bea_0039|the ship should be in within a week or ten days
anger_471_bea_0140|accept a fathers blessing and with it this
anger_472_bea_0001|author of the danger trail philip steels etc
anger_473_bea_0014|now youre coming down to business phil he exclaimed
anger_474_bea_0144|but there was something even more startling than this resemblance
anger_475_bea_0293|they were deep in the primeval forest
anger_476_bea_0266|they handled two men already both grubthieves
anger_477_bea_0214|besides he was paid one case of tobacco per head
anger_478_bea_0012|gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet
anger_479_bea_0319|and the edinburgh evening news says with editorial gloom
anger_481_bea_0065|they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
anger_482_bea_0078|then and at supper he tried to fathom her
anger_483_bea_0016|theres fort churchill a rifleshot beyond the ridge asleep
anger_484_bea_0244|he was the soul of devotion to his employers
anger_485_bea_0015|its the aurora borealis
anger_487_bea_0204|the wolfdog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him
anger_488_bea_0289|they are not regular oyster pirates nicholas continued
anger_489_bea_0253|he it was that lived to found the family of the patino
anger_490_bea_0331|poor little crookedleg was terribly scared
anger_492_bea_0021|it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
anger_493_bea_0006|god bless em i hope ill go on seeing them forever
anger_494_bea_0259|think of investing in such an adventure
anger_495_bea_0032|since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
anger_496_bea_0226|that came before my a b cs
anger_497_bea_0269|thats where they cut off the scottish chiefs and killed all hands
anger_498_bea_0139|he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
anger_499_bea_0055|philip stood undecided his ears strained to catch the slightest sound
anger_500_bea_0062|the men stared into each others face
anger_501_bea_0113|i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
anger_502_bea_0025|i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
anger_503_bea_0301|but all my dreams violated this law
anger_504_bea_0307|very early in my life i separated from my mother
anger_505_bea_0077|it is the fire partly she said
anger_506_bea_0138|in the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to jeanne
anger_507_bea_0265|the discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment
anger_508_bea_0043|it seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with gregson
anger_509_bea_0124|it was jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks
anger_510_bea_0018|there was a change now
anger_511_bea_0327|they were less stooped than we less springy in their movements
anger_512_bea_0097|then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
anger_513_bea_0302|it is very plausible to such people a most convincing hypothesis
anger_514_bea_0027|to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
anger_515_bea_0017|from that moment his friendship for belize turns to hatred and jealousy
anger_516_bea_0237|so hughie and i did the managing ourselves
anger_517_bea_0248|i had been sad too long already
anger_518_bea_0205|from now on were pals
anger_519_bea_0085|a trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
anger_520_bea_0110|much replied jeanne as tersely
anger_521_bea_0329|ah indeed
anger_522_bea_0236|dont you see i hate you
anger_523_bea_0137|then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
anger_524_bea_0103|but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
anger_525_bea_0141|it seems like a strange pointing of the hand of god
anger_526_bea_0073|the promoters eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
anger_527_bea_0297|theres a big english general right now whose name is roberts
anger_528_bea_0057|i have no idea replied philip
anger_529_bea_0291|the weeks had gone by and no overt acts had been attempted
anger_530_bea_0132|a cry of joy burst from philips lips
anger_531_bea_0060|anyway no one saw her like that
anger_532_bea_0322|this is a common experience with all of us
anger_533_bea_0316|we had been chased by them ourselves more than once
anger_534_bea_0134|he obeyed the pressure of her hand
anger_535_bea_0287|keep an eye on him
anger_536_bea_0028|robbery bribery fraud 
anger_537_bea_0099|a maddening joy pounded in his brain
anger_538_bea_0161|take away their foreman and they wouldnt be worth their grub
anger_539_bea_0147|a moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness
anger_540_bea_0136|about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
anger_541_bea_0234|why the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil
anger_542_bea_0026|it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
anger_543_bea_0294|he had been foiled in his attempt to escape
anger_544_bea_0011|if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
anger_545_bea_0321|the log on which lopear was lying got adrift
anger_546_bea_0054|there was nothing on the rock
anger_547_bea_0154|he was smoothshaven and his hair and eyes were black
anger_548_bea_0221|i dont know why youre here at all
anger_549_bea_0252|obrien had been a clean living young man with ideals
anger_550_bea_0050|in spite of their absurdity the words affected philip curiously
anger_551_bea_0202|she turned fearing that jacques might see what was in her face
anger_552_bea_0142|such things had occurred before he told philip
anger_553_bea_0037|i was the only one who remained sitting
anger_554_bea_0239|he cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter
anger_555_bea_0304|i graduated last of my class
anger_556_bea_0061|philip snatched at the letter which gregson held out to him
anger_557_bea_0047|close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolfdog
anger_558_bea_0292|here in the midmorning the first casualty occurred
anger_559_bea_0067|surely i will excuse you she cried
anger_560_bea_0267|eli harding asked as shunk started to follow
anger_561_bea_0072|but who was eileens double
anger_562_bea_0263|joan looked triumphantly at sheldon who bowed
anger_563_bea_0162|thats the subforeman explained thorpe
anger_564_bea_0209|it was not a large lake and almost round
anger_565_bea_0079|it was a large canoe
anger_566_bea_0243|i only read the quotations
anger_567_bea_0284|there was no forecasting this strange girls processes
anger_568_bea_0325|whizzipbang lopear screamed with sudden anguish
anger_569_bea_0166|two days ago jeanne learned where her fathers men were hiding
anger_571_bea_0270|and after the bath a shave would not be bad
anger_572_bea_0223|my im almost homesick for it already
anger_574_bea_0198|sometimes her dreams were filled with visions
anger_575_bea_0160|you want to go over and see his gang throw dirt
anger_576_bea_0330|redeye never committed a more outrageous deed
anger_577_bea_0286|give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping
anger_578_bea_0038|well have to watch our chances
anger_579_bea_0105|only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
anger_580_bea_0275|there are no kiddies and half grown youths among them
anger_581_bea_0108|he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
anger_582_bea_0008|gad your letter came just in time
anger_583_bea_0212|fresh cases still able to walk they clustered about the spokesman
anger_584_bea_0096|perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
anger_585_bea_0071|what was the object of your little sensation
anger_586_bea_0296|bassett was a fastidious man
anger_587_bea_0083|a shadow was creeping over pierres eyes
anger_588_bea_0228|but it contributed to the smash
anger_589_bea_0081|what if she did not come to the rock
anger_590_bea_0088|he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
anger_591_bea_0283|the woman in you is only incidental accidental and irrelevant
anger_592_bea_0203|they were following the shore of a lake
anger_594_bea_0254|straight out they swam their heads growing smaller and smaller
anger_595_bea_0235|his voice was passionately rebellious
anger_596_bea_0165|they are to attack your camp tomorrow night
anger_597_bea_0229|the last one i knew was an overseer
anger_598_bea_0276|oolong atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference
anger_599_bea_0036|she turned in at the hotel
anger_600_bea_0218|the ringing of the big bell aroused him
anger_601_bea_0247|they ought to pass here some time today
anger_602_bea_0240|wash your hands of me
anger_603_bea_0242|i saw it when she rolled
anger_604_bea_0123|she had died from cold and starvation
anger_605_bea_0133|philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength
anger_606_bea_0145|i have to be careful of them as they tear very easily
anger_607_bea_0257|they are coming ashore whoever they are
anger_608_bea_0059|his immaculate appearance was gone
anger_609_bea_0095|a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
anger_610_bea_0033|he unfolded a long typewritten letter and handed it to gregson
anger_611_bea_0163|philip made no effort to follow
anger_612_bea_0264|and i hope youve got plenty of chain out captain young
anger_613_bea_0042|how could he explain his possession of the sketch
anger_614_bea_0167|i was near the cabin and saw you
anger_615_bea_0206|he says he bought him of jacques le beau
anger_616_bea_0024|it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
anger_617_bea_0211|it drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made
anger_618_bea_0225|i was brought up the way most girls in hawaii are brought up
anger_619_bea_0207|how much was it
anger_620_bea_0268|now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened
anger_621_bea_0121|they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
anger_622_bea_0068|in a flash philip followed its direction
anger_623_bea_0104|she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
anger_624_bea_0335|redeye swung back and forth on the branch farther down
anger_625_bea_0318|production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself
anger_627_bea_0114|her words sent a strange chill through philip
anger_629_bea_0258|soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays
anger_630_bea_0143|ah i had forgotten he exclaimed
anger_631_bea_0317|he was a wise hyena
anger_632_bea_0310|massage under tension was the cryptic reply
anger_633_bea_0129|her face was against his breast
anger_634_bea_0231|the resident commissioner is away in australia
anger_635_bea_0220|a dead man is of no use on a plantation
anger_636_bea_0306|he was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary
anger_637_bea_0251|i may manage to freight a cargo back as well
anger_638_bea_0046|the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
anger_639_bea_0150|goodbye pierre he shouted
anger_640_bea_0022|hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
anger_641_bea_0280|ill be out of my head in fifteen minutes
anger_642_bea_0084|scarcely had he uttered the name when pierres closing eyes shot open
anger_643_bea_0262|they wouldnt be sweeping a big vessel like the martha
anger_644_bea_0009|he turned sharply and faced gregson across the table
anger_645_bea_0035|he stopped and philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes
anger_646_bea_0326|cherokee identified himself with his instinct
anger_647_bea_0053|suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
anger_648_bea_0273|they are big trees and require plenty of room
anger_649_bea_0049|gregson was asleep when he reentered the cabin
anger_650_bea_0197|such a dog the wise driver kills or turns loose
anger_651_bea_0233|i never allow what cant be changed to annoy me
anger_652_bea_0112|he was wounded in the arm
anger_653_bea_0100|you must sleep he urged
anger_654_bea_0051|the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
anger_655_bea_0222|what part of the united states is your home
anger_656_bea_0024|it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
anger_657_bea_0030|i had faith in them
anger_658_bea_0063|yes it was a man who asked a stranger
anger_659_bea_0277|mccoy found a stifling poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin
anger_660_bea_0080|what if jeanne failed him
anger_661_bea_0290|one by one the boys were captured
anger_662_bea_0118|pierre obeys me when we are together
anger_663_bea_0272|you can take a vacation on pay
anger_664_bea_0089|the nightglow was treacherous to shoot by
anger_665_bea_0295|and twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows
anger_666_bea_0278|it would give me nervous prostration
anger_667_bea_0230|do you know any good land around here
anger_668_bea_0075|there has been a change she interrupted him
anger_669_bea_0274|and raoul listened again to the tale of the house
anger_670_bea_0135|i am going to surprise father and you will go with pierre
anger_671_bea_0152|philip thrust himself against it and entered
anger_672_bea_0069|it was his intention to return to eileen and her father
anger_673_bea_0076|the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
anger_674_bea_0064|the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
anger_675_bea_0146|of course that is uninteresting she continued
anger_676_bea_0056|pearces little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly
anger_677_bea_0023|a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
anger_678_bea_0232|i cannot follow you she said
anger_679_bea_0074|and now down there eileen was waiting for him
anger_680_bea_0122|two years ago i gave up civilization for this
anger_681_bea_0126|each day she became a more vital part of him
anger_682_bea_0312|it lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass
anger_683_bea_0031|they were three hundred yards apart
anger_684_bea_0250|he had observed the business life of hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition
anger_685_bea_0066|he saw jeanne falter for a moment
anger_686_bea_0201|he cried and swung the club wildly
anger_687_bea_0045|he moved away as quietly as he had come
anger_688_bea_0314|thus was momentum gained in the younger world
anger_689_bea_0127|it was a temptation but he resisted it
anger_691_bea_0013|he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
anger_692_bea_0323|he considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat
anger_693_bea_0153|macdougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger
anger_694_bea_0320|with my strength i slammed it full into redeyes face
anger_695_bea_0005|will we ever forget it
anger_696_bea_0159|they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
anger_697_bea_0020|clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
anger_698_bea_0299|i tell you i am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot
anger_699_bea_0216|the other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him
anger_700_bea_0241|i think its much nicer to quarrel
anger_701_bea_0238|it happened to him at the gallina society in oakland one afternoon
anger_702_bea_0261|i have been doubly baptized
anger_703_bea_0313|brokentooth yelled with fright and pain
anger_704_bea_0249|all eyes however were staring at him in certitude of expectancy
anger_705_bea_0119|jeanne was turning the bow shoreward
anger_706_bea_0215|they die out of spite
anger_707_bea_0300|from my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror
anger_708_bea_0156|a strange fire burned in his eyes when thorpe turned
anger_709_bea_0070|he would first hunt up gregson and begin his work there
anger_710_bea_0101|you you would not keep the truth from me
anger_711_bea_0040|i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
anger_712_bea_0245|out of his eighteen hundred he laid aside sixteen hundred each year
anger_713_bea_0281|i do not blame you for anything remember that
anger_714_bea_0255|you wont die of malnutrition be sure of that
anger_715_bea_0217|oppressive as the heat had been it was now even more oppressive
anger_716_bea_0285|but what they want with your toothbrush is more than i can imagine
anger_717_bea_0213|between him and the beach was the canegrass fence of the compound
anger_718_bea_0210|its diameter was not more than two hundred yards
anger_719_bea_0149|for an instant he saw pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky
anger_720_bea_0052|it was a curious coincidence
anger_721_bea_0334|hell knock you off a few sticks in no time
anger_722_bea_0199|thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day
anger_723_bea_0246|you have heard always how he was the lover of the princess naomi
anger_724_bea_0034|men of seldens stamp dont stop at women and children
anger_725_bea_0092|he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
anger_726_bea_0155|wont you draw up gentlemen
anger_727_bea_0305|they had no fixed values to be altered by adjectives and adverbs
anger_728_bea_0019|i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
anger_729_bea_0128|this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
anger_730_bea_0303|but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
anger_731_bea_0328|the fire people like ourselves lived in caves
anger_732_bea_0308|his infernal chattering worries me even now as i think of it
anger_733_bea_0158|does that look good
anger_734_bea_0082|his face was streaming with blood
anger_735_bea_0094|he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
anger_736_bea_0010|im playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
anger_737_bea_0168|low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
anger_739_bea_0151|and macdougall was beyond the trail with three weeks to spare
anger_740_bea_0029|their forces were already moving into the north country
anger_741_bea_0125|he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
anger_742_bea_0282|if you mean to insinuate  brentwood began hotly
anger_743_bea_0208|youth had come back to her freed from the yoke of oppression
anger_744_bea_0041|meanwhile ill go out to breathe a spell
anger_745_bea_0324|it was not redeyes way to forego revenge so easily
anger_746_bea_0090|the singing voice approached rapidly
anger_747_bea_0106|the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
anger_748_bea_0227|it was the same way with our revolvers and rifles
anger_749_bea_0109|do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
anger_750_bea_0116|was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
anger_751_bea_0333|this is no place for you
anger_752_bea_0086|death had come with terrible suddenness
anger_753_bea_0131|providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
anger_754_bea_0315|saxon waited for she knew a fresh idea had struck billy
anger_755_bea_0271|now please give a plain statement of what occurred
anger_756_bea_0003|for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
anger_757_bea_0058|i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
anger_758_bea_0336|so unexpected was my charge that i knocked him off his feet
anger_759_bea_0157|he had worshiped her as dante might have worshiped beatrice
anger_760_bea_0200|he leapt again and the club caught him once more
anger_762_bea_0004|lord but im glad to see you again phil
anger_763_bea_0311|therefore hurrah for the game
anger_764_bea_0219|at first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened
anger_765_bea_0164|he came first a year ago and revealed himself to jeanne
anger_766_bea_0130|she was his now forever
anger_767_bea_0002|not at this particular case tom apologized whittemore
anger_768_bea_0298|this tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave saxon a little joythrill
anger_769_bea_0091|his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
anger_770_bea_0120|my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
anger_771_bea_0107|if you only could know how i thank you
anger_772_bea_0260|nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
anger_773_bea_0288|those are my oysters he said at last
anger_774_bea_0087|philip bent lower and stared into the face of the dead man
anger_775_bea_0048|he looked at the handkerchief more closely
anger_776_bea_0256|see the length of the body and that elongated neck
anger_777_bea_0148|now these things had been struck dead within him
anger_778_bea_0115|he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
anger_779_bea_0007|and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
anger_780_bea_0111|instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
anger_783_bea_0044|her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to philip
anger_784_bea_0309|white leghorns said mrs mortimer
anger_785_jenie_0093|for a full minute he crouched and listened
anger_786_jenie_0098|shall i carry you
anger_787_jenie_0457|what i saw i could not at first believe
anger_788_jenie_0039|the ship should be in within a week or ten days
anger_789_jenie_0140|accept a fathers blessing and with it this
anger_790_jenie_0398|in the car were unwin and harrison while jones sat with the chauffeur
anger_791_jenie_0518|illuminating oil was becoming all profit
anger_792_jenie_0175|down there the earth was already swelling with life
anger_793_jenie_0001|author of the danger trail philip steels etc
anger_794_jenie_0467|and so early in the voyage too
anger_795_jenie_0180|if not lets say our prayers and go to bed
anger_796_jenie_0455|i obeyed and a minute or two later they stood before him
anger_797_jenie_0014|now youre coming down to business phil he exclaimed
anger_798_jenie_0155|wont you draw up gentlemen
anger_799_jenie_0293|they were deep in the primeval forest
anger_800_jenie_0266|they handled two men already both grubthieves
anger_801_jenie_0214|besides he was paid one case of tobacco per head
anger_802_jenie_0012|gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet
anger_803_jenie_0529|as i say he had tapped the message very rapidly
anger_804_jenie_0369|in partnership with daylight the pair raided the san jose interurban
anger_805_jenie_0319|and the edinburgh evening news says with editorial gloom
anger_806_jenie_0065|they closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel
anger_807_jenie_0078|then and at supper he tried to fathom her
anger_808_jenie_0016|theres fort churchill a rifleshot beyond the ridge asleep
anger_809_jenie_0244|he was the soul of devotion to his employers
anger_810_jenie_0015|its the aurora borealis
anger_811_jenie_0375|the butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants
anger_812_jenie_0187|ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine
anger_813_jenie_0499|and right there i saw and knew it all
anger_814_jenie_0204|the wolfdog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him
anger_815_jenie_0353|here the explosion of mirth drowned him out
anger_816_jenie_0289|they are not regular oyster pirates nicholas continued
anger_817_jenie_0331|poor little crookedleg was terribly scared
anger_818_jenie_0460|i had forgotten their existence
anger_819_jenie_0508|soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity
anger_820_jenie_0142|such things had occurred before he told philip
anger_821_jenie_0505|we fished sharks on niihau together
anger_822_jenie_0021|it fairly clubbed me into recognizing it
anger_823_jenie_0006|god bless em i hope ill go on seeing them forever
anger_824_jenie_0158|does that look good
anger_825_jenie_0259|think of investing in such an adventure
anger_826_jenie_0032|since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step
anger_827_jenie_0496|and tom king patiently endured
anger_828_jenie_0494|obrien took off his coat and bared his right arm
anger_829_jenie_0483|beyond dispute corry hutchinson had married mabel holmes
anger_830_jenie_0385|thats what carnegie did
anger_831_jenie_0226|that came before my a b cs
anger_832_jenie_0478|also she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the afterroom
anger_833_jenie_0269|thats where they cut off the scottish chiefs and killed all hands
anger_834_jenie_0139|he told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes
anger_835_jenie_0190|next to them the canada jays were most persistent
anger_836_jenie_0055|philip stood undecided his ears strained to catch the slightest sound
anger_837_jenie_0486|for the rest he was a mere automaton
anger_838_jenie_0461|ah we were very close together in that moment
anger_839_jenie_0062|the men stared into each others face
anger_840_jenie_0524|at once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states
anger_841_jenie_0402|curly rushed her antagonist who struck again and leaped aside
anger_842_jenie_0113|i suppose you picked that lingo up among the indians
anger_843_jenie_0025|i was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed
anger_844_jenie_0301|but all my dreams violated this law
anger_845_jenie_0463|they are his tongue by which he makes his knowledge articulate
anger_846_jenie_0307|very early in my life i separated from my mother
anger_847_jenie_0077|it is the fire partly she said
anger_848_jenie_0447|ah it is growing dark and darker
anger_849_jenie_0490|both johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked
anger_850_jenie_0453|eighteen hundred he calculated
anger_851_jenie_0138|in the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to jeanne
anger_852_jenie_0265|the discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment
anger_853_jenie_0043|it seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with gregson
anger_854_jenie_0124|it was jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks
anger_855_jenie_0018|there was a change now
anger_856_jenie_0417|it is also an insidious deceitful sun
anger_857_jenie_0102|he will follow us soon
anger_858_jenie_0327|they were less stooped than we less springy in their movements
anger_859_jenie_0511|there is more behind this than a mere university ideal
anger_860_jenie_0097|then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
anger_861_jenie_0302|it is very plausible to such people a most convincing hypothesis
anger_862_jenie_0027|to my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor
anger_863_jenie_0404|perrault found one with head buried in the grub box
anger_864_jenie_0157|he had worshiped her as dante might have worshiped beatrice
anger_865_jenie_0017|from that moment his friendship for belize turns to hatred and jealousy
anger_866_jenie_0194|he drank of the water cautiously
anger_867_jenie_0237|so hughie and i did the managing ourselves
anger_868_jenie_0380|but in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth
anger_869_jenie_0248|i had been sad too long already
anger_871_jenie_0205|from now on were pals
anger_872_jenie_0451|i noticed blood spouting from kerfoots left hand
anger_873_jenie_0110|much replied jeanne as tersely
anger_874_jenie_0493|the boy obrien was specially maltreated
anger_875_jenie_0146|of course that is uninteresting she continued
anger_876_jenie_0329|ah indeed
anger_877_jenie_0236|dont you see i hate you
anger_878_jenie_0462|but she swung obediently on her heel into the wind
anger_879_jenie_0137|then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure
anger_880_jenie_0383|to his surprise her answer was flat and uncompromising
anger_881_jenie_0152|philip thrust himself against it and entered
anger_882_jenie_0103|but there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
anger_883_jenie_0481|nimrod replied with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness
anger_884_jenie_0168|low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting
anger_885_jenie_0073|the promoters eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them
anger_886_jenie_0297|theres a big english general right now whose name is roberts
anger_887_jenie_0057|i have no idea replied philip
anger_888_jenie_0291|the weeks had gone by and no overt acts had been attempted
anger_889_jenie_0132|a cry of joy burst from philips lips
anger_890_jenie_0060|anyway no one saw her like that
anger_891_jenie_0495|he bore no grudges and had few enemies
anger_892_jenie_0504|he was an athlete and a giant
anger_893_jenie_0322|this is a common experience with all of us
anger_894_jenie_0316|we had been chased by them ourselves more than once
anger_895_jenie_0134|he obeyed the pressure of her hand
anger_896_jenie_0287|keep an eye on him
anger_897_jenie_0028|robbery bribery fraud 
anger_898_jenie_0441|violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
anger_899_jenie_0099|a maddening joy pounded in his brain
anger_900_jenie_0430|nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance
anger_901_jenie_0423|mcveigh when he returns from a trip to honolulu
anger_902_jenie_0136|about him everywhere were the evidences of luxury and of age
anger_903_jenie_0234|why the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil
anger_904_jenie_0407|mercedes screamed cried laughed and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria
anger_905_jenie_0469|the eastern heavens were equally spectacular
anger_906_jenie_0026|it occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting
anger_907_jenie_0472|he is too keenly intelligent too sharply sensitive successfully to endure
anger_908_jenie_0294|he had been foiled in his attempt to escape
anger_909_jenie_0011|if i ever needed a fighter in my life i need one now
anger_910_jenie_0321|the log on which lopear was lying got adrift
anger_911_jenie_0054|there was nothing on the rock
anger_912_jenie_0391|but he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith
anger_913_jenie_0221|i dont know why youre here at all
anger_914_jenie_0425|otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring
anger_915_jenie_0196|he began to follow the footprints of the dog
anger_916_jenie_0252|obrien had been a clean living young man with ideals
anger_917_jenie_0050|in spite of their absurdity the words affected philip curiously
anger_918_jenie_0037|i was the only one who remained sitting
anger_919_jenie_0506|the claudine was leaving next morning for honolulu
anger_920_jenie_0239|he cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter
anger_921_jenie_0304|i graduated last of my class
anger_922_jenie_0487|the river bared its bosom and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness
anger_923_jenie_0413|but i am at the end of my resources
anger_924_jenie_0061|philip snatched at the letter which gregson held out to him
anger_925_jenie_0047|close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolfdog
anger_926_jenie_0156|a strange fire burned in his eyes when thorpe turned
anger_927_jenie_0464|between the rush of the cascades streaks of rust showed everywhere
anger_928_jenie_0292|here in the midmorning the first casualty occurred
anger_929_jenie_0067|surely i will excuse you she cried
anger_930_jenie_0267|eli harding asked as shunk started to follow
anger_931_jenie_0072|but who was eileens double
anger_932_jenie_0263|joan looked triumphantly at sheldon who bowed
anger_933_jenie_0209|it was not a large lake and almost round
anger_934_jenie_0439|at sea wednesday march 18 1908
anger_935_jenie_0079|it was a large canoe
anger_936_jenie_0195|but a strange thing happened
anger_937_jenie_0243|i only read the quotations
anger_938_jenie_0284|there was no forecasting this strange girls processes
anger_939_jenie_0177|she had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled
anger_940_jenie_0325|whizzipbang lopear screamed with sudden anguish
anger_941_jenie_0519|such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land
anger_942_jenie_0270|and after the bath a shave would not be bad
anger_943_jenie_0223|my im almost homesick for it already
anger_944_jenie_0428|it was not exactly a deportation
anger_945_jenie_0198|sometimes her dreams were filled with visions
anger_946_jenie_0341|why doggone you all shake again
anger_947_jenie_0330|redeye never committed a more outrageous deed
anger_948_jenie_0356|you dont catch me at any such foolishness
anger_949_jenie_0286|give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping
anger_950_jenie_0038|well have to watch our chances
anger_951_jenie_0337|encouraged by my conduct bigface became a sudden ally
anger_952_jenie_0105|only it is so wonderful so almost impossible to believe
anger_953_jenie_0275|there are no kiddies and half grown youths among them
anger_954_jenie_0108|he waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
anger_955_jenie_0532|may drought destroy your crops
anger_956_jenie_0188|two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass
anger_957_jenie_0008|gad your letter came just in time
anger_958_jenie_0212|fresh cases still able to walk they clustered about the spokesman
anger_959_jenie_0339|they obeyed him and went here and there at his commands
anger_960_jenie_0435|what do you mean by this outrageous conduct
anger_961_jenie_0096|perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
anger_962_jenie_0071|what was the object of your little sensation
anger_963_jenie_0296|bassett was a fastidious man
anger_964_jenie_0363|it is not an attempt to smash the market
anger_965_jenie_0083|a shadow was creeping over pierres eyes
anger_966_jenie_0228|but it contributed to the smash
anger_967_jenie_0192|he did not rush in
anger_968_jenie_0081|what if she did not come to the rock
anger_969_jenie_0088|he made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling
anger_970_jenie_0521|without them he could not run his empire
anger_971_jenie_0400|manuel had one besetting sin
anger_972_jenie_0416|the added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour
anger_973_jenie_0422|halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider
anger_974_jenie_0401|the man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club
anger_975_jenie_0283|the woman in you is only incidental accidental and irrelevant
anger_976_jenie_0203|they were following the shore of a lake
anger_977_jenie_0409|he could feel a new stir in the land
anger_978_jenie_0364|we have plenty of capital ourselves and yet we want more
anger_979_jenie_0185|the questions may have come vaguely in his mind
anger_980_jenie_0432|the boy at the wheel lost his head
anger_981_jenie_0427|enters now the psychology of the situation
anger_982_jenie_0352|im sure going along with you all elijah
anger_983_jenie_0254|straight out they swam their heads growing smaller and smaller
anger_984_jenie_0235|his voice was passionately rebellious
anger_985_jenie_0229|the last one i knew was an overseer
anger_986_jenie_0488|their love burned with increasing brightness
anger_987_jenie_0276|oolong atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference
anger_988_jenie_0485|each insult added to the value of the claim
anger_989_jenie_0036|she turned in at the hotel
anger_990_jenie_0507|in short my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics
anger_991_jenie_0218|the ringing of the big bell aroused him
anger_992_jenie_0520|he was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem
anger_993_jenie_0247|they ought to pass here some time today
anger_994_jenie_0240|wash your hands of me
anger_995_jenie_0242|i saw it when she rolled
anger_996_jenie_0123|she had died from cold and starvation
anger_997_jenie_0167|i was near the cabin and saw you
anger_998_jenie_0397|call me that again he murmured ecstatically
anger_999_jenie_0386|i cant argue with you and you know that
anger_1000_jenie_0133|philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength
anger_1001_jenie_0257|they are coming ashore whoever they are
anger_1002_jenie_0394|its the strap hangers thatll keep us from going under
anger_1003_jenie_0059|his immaculate appearance was gone
anger_1004_jenie_0379|how old are you daddy
anger_1005_jenie_0426|they do not know the length of time of incubation
anger_1006_jenie_0095|a big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
anger_1007_jenie_0479|i tried to read george moore last night and was dreadfully bored
anger_1008_jenie_0033|he unfolded a long typewritten letter and handed it to gregson
anger_1009_jenie_0264|and i hope youve got plenty of chain out captain young
anger_1010_jenie_0042|how could he explain his possession of the sketch
anger_1011_jenie_0514|we are consumed in our own fleshpots
anger_1012_jenie_0144|but there was something even more startling than this resemblance
anger_1013_jenie_0332|unconsciously our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm
anger_1014_jenie_0206|he says he bought him of jacques le beau
anger_1015_jenie_0491|and as in denial of guilt the onelegged boy replied
anger_1016_jenie_0515|but here amongst ourselves let us speak out
anger_1017_jenie_0176|for the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap
anger_1018_jenie_0179|tomorrow im going after that bear he said
anger_1019_jenie_0211|it drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made
anger_1020_jenie_0171|and when you come back in a few days bring eileen
anger_1021_jenie_0225|i was brought up the way most girls in hawaii are brought up
anger_1022_jenie_0193|it was edged with ice
anger_1023_jenie_0207|how much was it
anger_1024_jenie_0350|is that pat hanrahans mug looking hungry and willing
anger_1025_jenie_0268|now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened
anger_1026_jenie_0440|yes sir i corrected
anger_1027_jenie_0121|they ate dinner at the fifth and rested for two hours
anger_1028_jenie_0068|in a flash philip followed its direction
anger_1029_jenie_0480|tom spink has a harpoon
anger_1030_jenie_0418|the portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer
anger_1031_jenie_0448|i was hump cabin boy on the schooner ghost
anger_1032_jenie_0182|this time he did not yap for mercy
anger_1033_jenie_0104|she was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
anger_1034_jenie_0335|redeye swung back and forth on the branch farther down
anger_1035_jenie_0424|obviously it was a disease that could be contracted by contact
anger_1036_jenie_0172|gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar
anger_1037_jenie_0318|production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself
anger_1038_jenie_0145|i have to be careful of them as they tear very easily
anger_1039_jenie_0117|she added with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
anger_1040_jenie_0163|philip made no effort to follow
anger_1041_jenie_0184|dont you see im chewing this thing in two
anger_1042_jenie_0114|her words sent a strange chill through philip
anger_1043_jenie_0389|mab she said
anger_1044_jenie_0150|goodbye pierre he shouted
anger_1045_jenie_0523|they could not continue their method of producing surpluses
anger_1046_jenie_0258|soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays
anger_1047_jenie_0415|it lasted as a deterrent for two days
anger_1048_jenie_0317|he was a wise hyena
anger_1049_jenie_0154|he was smoothshaven and his hair and eyes were black
anger_1050_jenie_0310|massage under tension was the cryptic reply
anger_1051_jenie_0129|her face was against his breast
anger_1052_jenie_0231|the resident commissioner is away in australia
anger_1053_jenie_0340|it was like the beating of hoofs
anger_1054_jenie_0220|a dead man is of no use on a plantation
anger_1055_jenie_0306|he was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary
anger_1056_jenie_0251|i may manage to freight a cargo back as well
anger_1057_jenie_0526|nowhere did the raw earth appear
anger_1058_jenie_0046|the girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear
anger_1059_jenie_0528|men who endure it call it living death
anger_1060_jenie_0378|thats why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged
anger_1061_jenie_0022|hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition
anger_1062_jenie_0280|ill be out of my head in fifteen minutes
anger_1063_jenie_0173|the date was nearly eighteen years old
anger_1064_jenie_0370|he saw all men in the business game doing this
anger_1065_jenie_0405|it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work
anger_1066_jenie_0084|scarcely had he uttered the name when pierres closing eyes shot open
anger_1067_jenie_0388|it was my idea to a tee
anger_1068_jenie_0262|they wouldnt be sweeping a big vessel like the martha
anger_1069_jenie_0347|they are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound
anger_1070_jenie_0009|he turned sharply and faced gregson across the table
anger_1071_jenie_0035|he stopped and philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes
anger_1072_jenie_0362|nope not the slightest idea
anger_1073_jenie_0393|already he had begun borrowing from the banks
anger_1074_jenie_0326|cherokee identified himself with his instinct
anger_1075_jenie_0053|suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief
anger_1076_jenie_0273|they are big trees and require plenty of room
anger_1077_jenie_0049|gregson was asleep when he reentered the cabin
anger_1078_jenie_0197|such a dog the wise driver kills or turns loose
anger_1079_jenie_0456|but it wont continue she said with easy confidence
anger_1080_jenie_0348|they only lifted seven hundred and fifty
anger_1081_jenie_0233|i never allow what cant be changed to annoy me
anger_1082_jenie_0497|king took every advantage he knew
anger_1083_jenie_0112|he was wounded in the arm
anger_1084_jenie_0473|the night was calm and snowy
anger_1085_jenie_0408|the eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test
anger_1086_jenie_0100|you must sleep he urged
anger_1087_jenie_0051|the lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow
anger_1088_jenie_0501|youre joking me sir the other managed to articulate
anger_1089_jenie_0222|what part of the united states is your home
anger_1090_jenie_0376|your price my son is just about thirty per week
anger_1091_jenie_0359|earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan
anger_1092_jenie_0024|it was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy
anger_1093_jenie_0030|i had faith in them
anger_1094_jenie_0373|points of view new ideas life
anger_1095_jenie_0063|yes it was a man who asked a stranger
anger_1096_jenie_0183|and the air was growing chilly
anger_1097_jenie_0498|the lines were now very taut
anger_1098_jenie_0277|mccoy found a stifling poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin
anger_1099_jenie_0169|suddenly jeanne stopped for an instant
anger_1100_jenie_0517|out of abstractions ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it
anger_1101_jenie_0450|no man ate of the seal meat or the oil
anger_1102_jenie_0345|she was trying to pass the apron string around him
anger_1103_jenie_0080|what if jeanne failed him
anger_1104_jenie_0502|anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to molokai
anger_1105_jenie_0474|i sailed third mate in the little vampire before you were born
anger_1106_jenie_0290|one by one the boys were captured
anger_1107_jenie_0396|a rising tide of fat had submerged them
anger_1108_jenie_0431|wada and nakata were in a bit of a funk
anger_1109_jenie_0118|pierre obeys me when we are together
anger_1110_jenie_0186|like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl
anger_1111_jenie_0224|she nodded and her eyes grew soft and moist
anger_1112_jenie_0272|you can take a vacation on pay
anger_1113_jenie_0437|by that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell
anger_1114_jenie_0089|the nightglow was treacherous to shoot by
anger_1115_jenie_0295|and twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows
anger_1116_jenie_0358|they continued valiantly to lie but the truth continued to outrun them
anger_1117_jenie_0278|it would give me nervous prostration
anger_1118_jenie_0230|do you know any good land around here
anger_1119_jenie_0075|there has been a change she interrupted him
anger_1120_jenie_0135|i am going to surprise father and you will go with pierre
anger_1121_jenie_0069|it was his intention to return to eileen and her father
anger_1122_jenie_0076|the gray eyes faltered the flush deepened
anger_1123_jenie_0170|there was none of the joy of meeting in his face
anger_1124_jenie_0064|the fourth and fifth days passed without any developments
anger_1125_jenie_0392|there is that magnificent bob eating his head off in the stable
anger_1126_jenie_0056|pearces little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly
anger_1127_jenie_0023|a combination of canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges
anger_1128_jenie_0531|in what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining
anger_1129_jenie_0164|he came first a year ago and revealed himself to jeanne
anger_1130_jenie_0232|i cannot follow you she said
anger_1131_jenie_0181|so cheer up and give us your paw
anger_1132_jenie_0074|and now down there eileen was waiting for him
anger_1133_jenie_0411|it will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand
anger_1134_jenie_0346|get down and dig in
anger_1135_jenie_0122|two years ago i gave up civilization for this
anger_1136_jenie_0126|each day she became a more vital part of him
anger_1137_jenie_0312|it lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass
anger_1138_jenie_0354|fresh meat they failed to obtain
anger_1139_jenie_0151|and macdougall was beyond the trail with three weeks to spare
anger_1140_jenie_0161|take away their foreman and they wouldnt be worth their grub
anger_1141_jenie_0338|the fighting had now become intermittent
anger_1142_jenie_0031|they were three hundred yards apart
anger_1143_jenie_0250|he had observed the business life of hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition
anger_1144_jenie_0066|he saw jeanne falter for a moment
anger_1145_jenie_0482|and their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out
anger_1146_jenie_0377|this sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place
anger_1147_jenie_0201|he cried and swung the club wildly
anger_1148_jenie_0147|a moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness
anger_1149_jenie_0045|he moved away as quietly as he had come
anger_1150_jenie_0314|thus was momentum gained in the younger world
anger_1151_jenie_0127|it was a temptation but he resisted it
anger_1152_jenie_0013|he was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique
anger_1153_jenie_0412|there is another virtue in these bulkheads
anger_1154_jenie_0323|he considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat
anger_1155_jenie_0510|much more ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment
anger_1156_jenie_0320|with my strength i slammed it full into redeyes face
anger_1157_jenie_0438|at sea monday march 16 1908
anger_1158_jenie_0005|will we ever forget it
anger_1159_jenie_0484|nosiree
anger_1160_jenie_0020|clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
anger_1161_jenie_0299|i tell you i am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot
anger_1162_jenie_0216|the other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him
anger_1163_jenie_0241|i think its much nicer to quarrel
anger_1164_jenie_0143|ah i had forgotten he exclaimed
anger_1165_jenie_0238|it happened to him at the gallina society in oakland one afternoon
anger_1166_jenie_0160|you want to go over and see his gang throw dirt
anger_1167_jenie_0261|i have been doubly baptized
anger_1168_jenie_0410|so we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well
anger_1169_jenie_0351|it was more like sugar
anger_1170_jenie_0403|his newborn cunning gave him poise and control
anger_1171_jenie_0395|as for himself werent the street railway earnings increasing steadily
anger_1172_jenie_0313|brokentooth yelled with fright and pain
anger_1173_jenie_0249|all eyes however were staring at him in certitude of expectancy
anger_1174_jenie_0445|the creative joy i murmured
anger_1175_jenie_0119|jeanne was turning the bow shoreward
anger_1176_jenie_0215|they die out of spite
anger_1177_jenie_0355|a burst of laughter was his reward
anger_1178_jenie_0300|from my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror
anger_1179_jenie_0387|bob growing disgusted turned back suddenly and attempted to pass mab
anger_1180_jenie_0444|then you dont believe in altruism
anger_1181_jenie_0070|he would first hunt up gregson and begin his work there
anger_1182_jenie_0148|now these things had been struck dead within him
anger_1183_jenie_0178|every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
anger_1184_jenie_0101|you you would not keep the truth from me
anger_1185_jenie_0360|but he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion
anger_1186_jenie_0382|daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man
anger_1187_jenie_0414|now our figuring was all right
anger_1188_jenie_0471|i saw mr pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically
anger_1189_jenie_0141|it seems like a strange pointing of the hand of god
anger_1190_jenie_0449|a sinewy hand dripping with water was clutching the rail
anger_1191_jenie_0040|i suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
anger_1192_jenie_0245|out of his eighteen hundred he laid aside sixteen hundred each year
anger_1193_jenie_0281|i do not blame you for anything remember that
anger_1194_jenie_0357|a month passed by and bonanza creek remained quiet
anger_1195_jenie_0255|you wont die of malnutrition be sure of that
anger_1196_jenie_0217|oppressive as the heat had been it was now even more oppressive
anger_1197_jenie_0419|the portuguese boy passed the hawaiian
anger_1198_jenie_0285|but what they want with your toothbrush is more than i can imagine
anger_1199_jenie_0470|he spat it out like so much venom
anger_1200_jenie_0213|between him and the beach was the canegrass fence of the compound
anger_1201_jenie_0384|the farmer works the soil and produces grain
anger_1202_jenie_0210|its diameter was not more than two hundred yards
anger_1203_jenie_0443|he was worth nothing to the world
anger_1204_jenie_0052|it was a curious coincidence
anger_1205_jenie_0334|hell knock you off a few sticks in no time
anger_1206_jenie_0199|thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day
anger_1207_jenie_0246|you have heard always how he was the lover of the princess naomi
anger_1208_jenie_0034|men of seldens stamp dont stop at women and children
anger_1209_jenie_0092|he went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores
anger_1210_jenie_0390|ill go over tomorrow afternoon
anger_1211_jenie_0429|quick was the disappointment in his face yet smiling was the acquiescence
anger_1212_jenie_0442|you live on an income which your father earned
anger_1213_jenie_0191|for a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
anger_1214_jenie_0305|they had no fixed values to be altered by adjectives and adverbs
anger_1215_jenie_0019|i followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances
anger_1216_jenie_0509|yet in accordance with ernests test of truth it worked
anger_1217_jenie_0128|this one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born
anger_1218_jenie_0374|but lifes worth more than cash she argued
anger_1219_jenie_0303|but they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality
anger_1220_jenie_0433|to her the bridge was tambo which is the native for taboo
anger_1221_jenie_0328|the fire people like ourselves lived in caves
anger_1222_jenie_0522|for such countries nothing remained but reorganization
anger_1223_jenie_0308|his infernal chattering worries me even now as i think of it
anger_1224_jenie_0342|seventeen no eighteen days ago
anger_1225_jenie_0082|his face was streaming with blood
anger_1226_jenie_0094|he had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
anger_1227_jenie_0349|it was simple in its way and no virtue of his
anger_1228_jenie_0010|im playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game
anger_1229_jenie_0468|in the matter of curry she is a sheer genius
anger_1230_jenie_0527|the lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield
anger_1231_jenie_0381|my names ferguson
anger_1232_jenie_0530|ask him i laughed then turned to pasquini
anger_1233_jenie_0029|their forces were already moving into the north country
anger_1234_jenie_0446|he deluged me overwhelmed me with argument
anger_1235_jenie_0489|they were artists not biologists
anger_1236_jenie_0174|they were the presage of storm
anger_1237_jenie_0125|he was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself
anger_1238_jenie_0282|if you mean to insinuate  brentwood began hotly
anger_1239_jenie_0421|by golly the boy wins
anger_1240_jenie_0208|youth had come back to her freed from the yoke of oppression
anger_1241_jenie_0459|theres too much of the schoolboy in me
anger_1242_jenie_0466|captain west may be a samurai but he is also human
anger_1243_jenie_0420|when i came to i was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically
anger_1244_jenie_0041|meanwhile ill go out to breathe a spell
anger_1245_jenie_0452|three oilers and a fourth engineer was his greeting
anger_1246_jenie_0324|it was not redeyes way to forego revenge so easily
anger_1247_jenie_0090|the singing voice approached rapidly
anger_1248_jenie_0372|he saw only the effect in a general sketchy way
anger_1249_jenie_0106|the emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
anger_1250_jenie_0227|it was the same way with our revolvers and rifles
anger_1251_jenie_0434|a half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds
anger_1252_jenie_0458|the stout wood was crushed like an eggshell
anger_1253_jenie_0159|they look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life
anger_1254_jenie_0109|do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
anger_1255_jenie_0116|was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
anger_1256_jenie_0500|who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury
anger_1257_jenie_0166|two days ago jeanne learned where her fathers men were hiding
anger_1258_jenie_0333|this is no place for you
anger_1259_jenie_0086|death had come with terrible suddenness
anger_1260_jenie_0131|providence had delivered him through the maelstrom
anger_1261_jenie_0315|saxon waited for she knew a fresh idea had struck billy
anger_1262_jenie_0271|now please give a plain statement of what occurred
anger_1263_jenie_0371|it issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal
anger_1264_jenie_0003|for the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands
anger_1265_jenie_0058|i came for information more out of curiosity than anything else
anger_1266_jenie_0476|at this moment i felt a stir at my shoulder
anger_1267_jenie_0336|so unexpected was my charge that i knocked him off his feet
anger_1268_jenie_0436|but martin smiled a superior smile
anger_1269_jenie_0189|the bigeyed clucking moosebirds were most annoying
anger_1270_jenie_0516|also there was awe in their faces
anger_1271_jenie_0162|thats the subforeman explained thorpe
anger_1272_jenie_0406|and that was the last of francois and perrault
anger_1273_jenie_0454|the sharp voice of wolf larsen aroused me
anger_1274_jenie_0200|he leapt again and the club caught him once more
anger_1275_jenie_0004|lord but im glad to see you again phil
anger_1276_jenie_0311|therefore hurrah for the game
anger_1277_jenie_0219|at first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened
anger_1278_jenie_0130|she was his now forever
anger_1279_jenie_0361|but he did not broach it preferring to mature it carefully
anger_1280_jenie_0165|they are to attack your camp tomorrow night
anger_1281_jenie_0344|he seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality
anger_1282_jenie_0002|not at this particular case tom apologized whittemore
anger_1283_jenie_0298|this tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave saxon a little joythrill
anger_1284_jenie_0091|his blood grew hot with rage at the thought
anger_1285_jenie_0343|you mean for this state general alberta
anger_1286_jenie_0120|my right foot feels like that of a chinese debutante
anger_1287_jenie_0492|burnt out like the crater of a volcano
anger_1288_jenie_0503|his beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy
anger_1289_jenie_0107|if you only could know how i thank you
anger_1290_jenie_0477|wada louis and the steward are servants of asiatic breed
anger_1291_jenie_0260|nobody knew his history they of the junta least of all
anger_1292_jenie_0288|those are my oysters he said at last
anger_1293_jenie_0087|philip bent lower and stared into the face of the dead man
anger_1294_jenie_0153|macdougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger
anger_1295_jenie_0279|she said with chattering teeth
anger_1296_jenie_0048|he looked at the handkerchief more closely
anger_1297_jenie_0256|see the length of the body and that elongated neck
anger_1298_jenie_0475|his outstretched arm dropped to his side and he paused
anger_1299_jenie_0149|for an instant he saw pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky
anger_1300_jenie_0115|he had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
anger_1301_jenie_0007|and you always want to see it in the superlative degree
anger_1302_jenie_0399|and heres another idea
anger_1303_jenie_0111|instead he joined her and they ate like two hungry children
anger_1304_jenie_0512|no it is a palace wherein there are many servants
anger_1305_jenie_0044|her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to philip
anger_1306_jenie_0309|white leghorns said mrs mortimer
anger_1307_jenie_0465|hell never do a tap of work the whole voyage
